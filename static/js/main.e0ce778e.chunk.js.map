I\r\n        always loved changing the small settings in their computer to see what\r\n        would happen. I was very curious as a child and I would constantly ask\r\n        my dad about the quickly changing technology I saw around me. As I got\r\n        older, I would help my parents with minor computer problems they had,\r\n        and I realized I enjoyed it very much! I also used to hack Nintendo\r\n        consoles with my brother, we both installed{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(video_games)#Wii\">\r\n          Homebrew\r\n        </a>{\" \"}\r\n        software onto the Wii we used to use all the time. Wondering how these\r\n        hacks worked and how people were able to write the code for them got me\r\n        even more curious! Ever since then I have always been interested in\r\n        computers and technology.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2>\r\n        I started coding this website on 9.10.21.
